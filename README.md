# Antwerp Core Branding Sketch Library

This project contains the Sketch source file of Antwerp's core branding components. A visual overview can be found in the [Antwerp branding styleguide](https://a-ui.github.io/core_branding_scss/)

## Prerequisites

To use this library you'll need to have [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) installed, version 51 or higher.

## Getting started

To use the library in Sketch, simply copy-paste the following link in your browser's address bar and hit Enter:

`sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.antwerpen.be%2Fcore_branding_sketch%2Flibrary.xml`

This will open Sketch for you and everything necessary will start downloading.

After downloading the library to Sketch, you can access all the core branding components via the "Insert" menu. If you are unfamiliar with working with libraries in Sketch, please consult the following documentation on the Sketch website:

## Updates

Sketch will automatically inform you if there is an update available for our library on startup. Updates can then be downloaded from the "Libraries" tab in the "Preferences" panel.
